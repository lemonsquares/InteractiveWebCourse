            <img src="shapeshifter-art.jpg">
			<p>I chose this <a href="https://artsology.com/shapeshifter-art-game.php">ShapeShifter</a> art tool because it's a simple tool that can change shapes in relation to other shapes. It reminds me of the level of empathy that I carry. My emotions, behaviour and attitude often can be changed in relation to how other people are feeling, and I often have to step back and not be consumed by it. I also see this tool as an inspiration to limit yourself to creating art with what you have.</p>
			<p>As you can tell from my piece, I'm Giulia. I'm originally from Italy, but lived in Canada most of my life. I spent most of my younger years travelling, working and creating. My background is in photography, videography and graphic design. My goal was to introduce art theory into my mixed media practice. And throughout my two years at OCAD, I have fallen into game design and have enjoyed building experiential games. I'll be a third year student (this upcoming fall) in Digital Futures, with a minor in Games and Play.</p>
