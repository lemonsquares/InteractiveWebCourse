				<p>A website can be your own endless conveyer belt of creativity. It can feature items that are in-progress, incomplete or done.  It can endlessly loop around, and you can easily pick up or drop projects, while showcasing your progress with the world. I think social media gives people the opportunity to share with the world, but a lot of people feel the pressure to showcase completed work. I think if there was less pressure on showing a perfect profile of yourself, it would push creators to experiment more. Creators would spend more time in the process and showcase all the steps that led to the final or multiple final completed versions.</p>
