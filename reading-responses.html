            <h3 class="subheader"><a href="http://howtocrit.com/" target="_blank">By Mitch Goldstein</a></h3>
            <!-- QUESTION ONE -->
            <h4 class="question">What are some challenges you face when giving a critique?</h4>
            <p class="answer">From the times I have given and received critiques, I believe the challenges come from interpreting the critiques given and the critiques received. I have usually tried to keep my tone of voice impersonal and positive. I usually start my critique off on a positive comment about the work. Then I might ask impersonal questions to understand the intentions behind the work or how it was built, and what kind of exploration was done. I think there's a challenge between expressing genuine encouragement and interest in someone else’s work, than offering suggestions and corrective critique. I try to encourage exploration more and I hope my encouragement doesn't sound like a suggestion or a corrective critique.</p>
            <!-- QUESTION TWO -->
            <h4 class="question">How do you handle a critique that you disagree with?</h4>
            <p class="answer">I think it depends on the critique. I have heard critiques that are plainly rude, and I take them with a grain of salt and try to understand the meaning behind their message or comment. Whenever I receive a comment that I don’t understand, I ask further questions about their critique. Sometimes I think most people do not express themselves well enough to be misinterpreted. I have also heard critiques that put assumptions on the work, and do not take the time to understand the work or meaning behind it. Whenever I receive comments that sound rude or assuming, I try to understand the purpose behind it. "Can you explain or expand further?". I believe most critiques are not meant to sound rude and sometimes there is misinterpretation. I think taking things with a grain of salt helps.</p>
            <!-- QUESTION THREE -->
            <h4 class="question">What are some challenges you face when giving a critique?</h4>
            <p class="answer">I think critiques are a foundation for growth in every industry. It's not just for the art and design industries. It's an open rapport exchange. Your work is being presented in many different ways (in a classroom, in an office environment, in a job, etc) and it is open to criticism, but you have to trust that it will be positive and give you an opportunity to grow. That's why I think it's important to give and receive critiques in everyday life.</p>

            <h1 class="header">Reading Two: What Screens Want</h1>
            <h3 class="subheader"><a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/what-screens-want/" target="_blank">By Frank Chimero</a></h3>
            <h4 class="question">Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you think one is "better" than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other.</h4>
            <p class="answer">Skeuomorphic design was very popular during the early days of consumer grade graphics UI design. Its greatest advantage was in creating a familiar look and feel to help ease in new users, unfamiliar with digital interaction. In modern times it has almost completely fallen out of favour; with small areas of usage reserved for products such as smart-watches and applications where the technology takes a secondary role to fashion or a particular aesthetic style.</p>
            <p class="answer">From a practical standpoint it is not applicable to the modern world as almost every user is fully familiar with the digital environment and conventions. New design patterns have developed to guide users through interactive environments, and these patterns are far better suited to adaptive digital displays. Flat design is far more flexible, responsive, and functional - able to "Flex" and change as the UI changes. It can be created to respond to UI preferences, such as colour-blind modes and other accessibility features. Flat design offers many advantages over Skeuomorphism, and in the modern age it is equally as intuitive.</p>
            <h4 class="question">What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.</h4>
            <p class="answer">A zoopraxiscope was one of the first technologies that allowed animated images to be created and repeatedly played without requiring a performer, such as with shadow-puppetry. Originally little more than a curiosity they eventually paved the way for the rise of cinema and a whole new genre of entertainment.</p>
            <p class="answer">Today the concept of repeatable animated graphics displayed on a screen is ubiquitous and embedded in almost every facet of life. From smart-phone application loading icons to train-platform information boards. The zoopraxiscope was the first incarnation of a concept that is prevalent today, but beyond the concept has no relationship to the modern implementation.</p>
            <p class="answer">A more conceptual aspect of design, that has applied to many artistic mediums including film-making, but also photography and painting, is the Rule of Thirds. This practice gives a sense of balance and ensures that attention is drawn to the important element, without overwhelming the entire scene. This rule has been adopted and used in web-design quite extensively. A common design pattern for websites and apps that need to convey multiple pieces of information, such as displaying a mixture of headlines, copy, images, is to follow the rule of thirds. Web pages following this principle feel balanced, accessible, and familiar to the user; likely, in part, because of how extensively it has been used in other mediums.</p>
            <h4 class="question">Do you agree with that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not.</h4>
            <p class="answer">Screens neither want to flux, nor do not want to flux. A screen is a passive communication medium. Just as a screen used to display an emergency exit sign must prioritise being static and clear, so must a television screen be fully animated. The concept of Fluxing described in the article, more commonly known as Responsive (or sometimes Reactive) Design has proven very effective in communicating subtleties of interaction to a user.</p>
            <p class="answer">Screens on modern interactive "smart" devices shift between many different modes of function frequently and seamlessly. For instance: watching an online video in a mobile app, and then moving down to expand and engage with the comment section. The app interface will transition from the video player to a responsive comment environment which will employ many of the "Flux" concepts described. This "Fluxing" has proven to be one of the most effective patterns that an interface can employ to help a user understand transitions and UI element relationships.</p> 
            <p class="answer">However, it is not a property of the screen itself, or even the screen-human interaction in totality. It is a tool. A tool for bridging certain gaps between the user and the digital abstraction of the environment that they are interacting with. And in many situations, it is highly effective, but not all situations. One example might be the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, which presents information that in a very simple and static format. The field of UX design is complex and challenging, and it is important for the designer to always be aware of a tool’s limitations. The concepts of "Flux" are very often going to be essential to creating an effective interactive online environment but simplifying that tendency to a dogmatic statement that a screen "wants" something is overly simplistic and could obscure other considerations.</p>

            <h1 class="header">Reading Three: Turing Complete User</h1>
            <h3 class="subheader"><a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/" target="_blank">By Olia Lialina</a></h3>
            <h4 class="question">What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?</h4>
            <p class="answer">Lialina's opinion is that “users” are converting into people as in a whole society of users. She believes that with the advancement of invisible computing AKA mobile computing, the user will become invisible. There will not be certain demographics of users with needs and wants because they will all be general-purpose users who will become flexible with their devices.</p>
            <p class="answer">I disagree with her opinion of the word user and I don’t think people will settle into the general-purpose user. She offers examples from companies that market to the general public because we now live in a society that lives online either through a computer or mobile device. There are not many requirements nowadays to access the online web. But there are still many people that do not use their devices just for the sole purpose of online.  There are still companies that target certain demographics or users and these users do rely on certain products to meet their wants and needs. They expect technology to improve. I don’t believe the user will become invisible because we’re still here demanding better technology that will meet all our needs and more instead of settling into general purpose software.</p>
            <h4 class="question">What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</h4>
            <p class="answer">Lialina’s ideal internet user / general purpose user is someone who does not rely on the hardware or software capabilities of their device. They can achieve their daily goals easily and almost automatically by using the software they currently have, instead of seeking software they do not and may be too convoluted. They can be flexible enough to – as she puts it – write a document in an email web browser, which has most of the same capabilities of a document writing software. They’re not relying on software that is built just for that purpose.</p>
            <h4 class="question">From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</h4>
            <p class="answer">I think most social media sites are a good example of sites that require users to fill gaps. These sites rely mostly on content sharing, active engagement and advertising. People who share content on social media are providing fillers for these gaps / empty web space. There is an engagement between users who share and users who view the content and without this relationship, these websites would not continue running.</p>
            <p class="answer">Reddit is a good example as it is a purely content sharing site. It is only able to continue running based on user engagement and interaction. Users share content in certain groups (subreddits) and other users upvote or downvote to achieve greater visibility or invisibility. If users did not share any content whatsoever, the website would almost be a blank page apart from the headers. Hence, why the website must have constant engagement from the users.</p>

            <h1 class="header">Reading Four: My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge.</h1>
            <h3 class="subheader"><a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/" target="_blank">By Laurel Schwulst</a></h3>
            <h4 class="question">Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</h4>
            <p class="answer">Most of the internet is full of people using it for social media, but there are lots of restrictions hidden in the terms of conditions of a website that is owned by a corporation. You are restricted to using their platform, restricted to sharing content in a box size of their choosing, and content of your work must always follow their rules.  On top of sharing content with the people in their lives and society, they are sharing their private information to these corporations and they in turn sell your data.</p>
            <p class="answer">It’s a dilemma that we all deal with when we use social media. How do we share our lives without corporations benefiting from us? There isn’t a simple answer to this. I think Schwulst advocates for individual websites as a step towards taking back that data and creating without restrictions. She makes her case by empowering users and creators by converting them into both “builders and architects”. We can design websites not to fit into a conventional box. Her different metaphors are words of encouragement that we don’t need to design to conventional sizes. We can express ourselves broadly in a metaphysical sense to represent ourselves and our work.</p>
            <h4 class="question">In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. </h4>
            <p class="answer">A website can be your own endless conveyor belt of creativity. It can feature items that are in-progress, incomplete or done.  It can endlessly loop around, and you can easily pick up or drop projects, while showcasing your progress with the world. I think social media gives people the opportunity to share with the world, but a lot of people feel the pressure to showcase completed work. I think if there was less pressure on showing a perfect profile of yourself, it would push creators to experiment more. Creators would spend more time in the process and showcase all the steps that led to the final or multiple final completed versions.</p>

            <h3 class="subheader"><a href="https://www.are.na/blog/the-poetry-of-tools" target="_blank">By Mindy Seu</a></h3>
            <h4 class="question">In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</h4>
            <p class="answer">People use technology almost instinctively as behaviours, but we don’t actively listen to our devices talking to us. We send commands by a mouse click or touch or keyboard press. We don’t think of our intentions behind each action we place on technology. When we use technology, we don’t consider the actions our software or even hardware (tools) does to make it possible. We don’t consider their purpose on a metaphysical level. She wants humanity to consider each action of interactivity with technology. For example, as I sit typing at my laptop, the word program will start flashing a line waiting for my next word. The mouse cursor will disappear and hide, but once I move it again, it will reappear. I am communicating with my software, and it communicates back.</p>
            <p class="answer">There’s an expression that is often said online about interacting with other humans. “You should consider the human behind the screen.” It usually means to consider their intentions or lack of behind it. I think people should consider the technology behind the screen. Consider your actions and the impact, even if it may seem frivolous or unimportant. Once we realize each action or even inaction we place on technology, we gain a sense of communication with technology, a language. I believe there is an opportunity to take these interactions of communication and make art or even poetry.</p>
            <h4 class="question">Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</h4>
            <p class="answer">Performing Data: Digital technology has different hidden languages underneath, and they are constantly communicating within a network either locally or online. We can’t see this data because it’s mostly not human readable. But finding ways to translate and express the content (or the exchange of data) in a new form that is human readable and / or familiar with us brings us closer to understanding and defamiliarizing the tools of technology.</p>
            <p class="answer">The <a href="https://nahee.app/handshake_erotica.html" target="_blank">handshake erotica</a> is a site explaining the exchange of data between a client and server. But it is set up as a sex educational infographic. I think infographics are a good form of visual communication for humans. Their purpose is to present a lot of information quickly and simply in mostly graphics with small amount of text.  This website takes a complicated exchange of data between a client and a server and explains it in a human readable way that is also visually appealing.</p>
