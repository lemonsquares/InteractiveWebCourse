                <p>
                    It started with research into typography that used shapes. I researched different oddly shapes. I was primarily inspired by my current mixed emotions of feeling disconnected yet still having a support system. I was previously living in the UK with my long-term partner, and I had this support system that a lot of people did not have because of the pandemic. Then I had to move back to Canada, and I was more disjointed from it than a complete disconnect, since I still have that connection with my partner. I wanted to primarily create letters that were disjointed, but still legible and still connected.

                <p>
                    Trying to convert my sketches into CSS was the most difficult part of this project. I started out with basic sans-serif font.

                <p>
                    This was an experiment with using curves and the border-radius tag.

                    Back to my original goal of trying to keep sharp diagonal lines in my design. 
                </p>
                <p>I also experimented with introducing shadows to my type, but it ended up being more time consuming and abandoned the idea.

                </figure>
                <p>
                    I struggled trying to disjoint the letters and keep the type consistent throughout. I ended up changing the position of triangle shapes to hopefully show a disjointed aesthetic.
